"""Configuration and HTTP client for the Morrison Securities Data Access API.

Loads credentials from the project ``.env`` file and exposes a single
``fetch_data()`` helper that performs a GET request against the configured
base URL.  The module intentionally avoids side effects on import, so it
can be safely reused by tests or other Python modules.
